<b><h2> Channel Encoding Risk Reduction Experiment </h2></b>

<b> Description </b>
For the first team risk reduction, we would like to test different implementations of channel encoding. 
We plan to split into three different subteams. Austin and Matt will be implementing convolutional encoding, 
and Carolyn will implement turbo coding, and Jaino, Phat and Neel will implement LDPC. Each team will 
implement their chosen channel encoding using some MATLAB library (LTE Toolbox). Familiarizing ourselves
with the library will be an important part of this experiment. Each subteam will further divide the experiment
by implementing multiple modulation schemes. See below for which modulation scheme has been assigned to each 
person. Each team will also write a high level description of how the encoding works, and create plots to 
help with visualization. Each team will create plots to demonstrate the signal to noise ratio vs BER, as 
well as the different code rates. Based on this experiment, we will select a coding scheme to use in the d
evelopment of our transmitter.
