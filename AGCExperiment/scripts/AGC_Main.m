%For loop is here because it allows us to test multiple different SNR
%values. It starts here b/c SNR values only affect noise in the channel,
%transmitter doesn't need to be in the for loop.
for index=1:length(SNR_vector)
    %% SIGNAL NOW TRANSMITTED, Channel Attentuation and Noise addition
    % In the channel, the attentuation factor will effect both the noise and
    % the original data itself. Corrected for attenuation factor noise will be
    % added to the signal that will be received on the other side.

    %Multiply the signal by the gain factor
    gainSignal = sourceWithTrainingSignal*gainFactor;

    %Add AWGN based on the SNR and Attenuation Factor!
    SNR = (gainFactor^2)*SNR_vector(index);           %New SNR w/ gain factor
    receivedSignal = awgn(gainSignal, 10*log10(SNR)); %SNR must be in DB, ARE UNITS RIGHT HERE???


    %% Training Sequence Detection (Austin and Carolyn)
    % Detects the corresponding training sequence (golay or pn), outputs the
    % training sequence and outputs the rest of the exclusively received data

    %% Automatic Gain Control (Phat and Joseph)
    % Use detected training sequence to estimate the gain factor. Then divide
    % that data signal by this factor to bring it back to (hopefully) right
    % amplitude level
    
    %Correct data signal based on the gain factor using the formula Javi
    %provided us with this last week. Should be a simple mathmatical
    %calculation.
    
    %-----AGC_Known_Function------
    %Stabilizes the amplitude of a received signal given that he original is
    %known
    %Inputs:    r - the signal to be equalized
    %           knownSignal - the known original signal
    %Outputs:   estimation - gain factor estimation   
    estimatedGain = AGC_Known_Function(noisyTSequence, training_sequence); %is modulated signal the signal expected at this point?
    
    gainControlledBits = receivedDataSignal/estimatedGain;
    
    gainErrorSquared = (gainFactor - estimatedGain)^2;
    gainError_vector(index) = gainErrorSquared;  %For plotting later

    %% Demodulate the data
    % Demodulates the data signal and assigns it to a final estimation of the
    % transmitted bits. Calculates the Bit Error Rate (Number of bit
    % errors/Total bits transmitted)

    %Use gainControlledBits and demodulate here

    %demodulatedBits = %The final estimation of the bits, TODO
